					<h1>The Brewery</h1>
					<p class="text">The brewery is located in a building that formerly housed the local auto parts 
					store. The facility underwent extensive remodeling from the ground up.  The atmosphere is warm 
					and inviting with tones of copper and gold throughout, including some amazingly beautiful barn 
					wood obtained from the Camas Creek Cattle and Sheep Company west of White Sulphur Springs.  And 
					perhaps, just perhaps, there is a picture of a basset hound here and there.
					</p>
					<p class="text">The Hedrich Family invites you to visit White Sulphur Springs and to enjoy its many amenities,
					including a locally crafted beer from 2 Basset Brewery. </p>

					<h1>Our Story</h1>
					<p class="text">Barry is a White Sulphur Springs native and obtained his Civil Engineering degree from 
					Montana State University in 1981.  Chris hails from Sheridan, Wyoming and has worked in the banking industry 
					since 1988.   They met while both working for Peter Kiewit&rsquo;s Decker Coal Company just outside of Sheridan, 
					Barry as a senior engineer and Chris as the payroll clerk.  After what Chris describes as a painfully long 
					courting period (5 years), they were married in 1988 and began ranching and farming near Ringling, Montana.  
					After selling the ranch, they moved into White Sulphur Springs and continued to raise their two children Hank 
					and Molly.</p>
					<p class="text">With Hank and Molly soon to start out on their own, they found themselves looking for something to fill the 
					pending emptiness.  Enter the basset hounds.  With really no good reason to get a basset hound other than Hank 
					wanting one, they got Stanley when Hank graduated from high school in 2009 and Leroy followed when Molly graduated 
					in 2012.  Enter the beer.  (Okay, beer came well before the bassets, but the idea of doing more than just drinking 
					it came after.)  Having a fondness for beer and being curious about the science and chemistry of brewing, Barry 
					began experimenting, to the delight of family and friends who much enjoyed his brews.</p>
					<p class="text">Oddly, the Hedrichs&rsquo; found many similarities between bassets and beer:  basset hounds are friendly and very social, 
					laid back, sometimes they behave and sometimes they don&rsquo;t. But without fail, they make you laugh.  Folks enjoy sharing
					a beer with family and friends for some of the very same reasons: because it is relaxing, social, and generally laughter 
					abounds. Hence 2 Basset Brewery was born.</p>
